<p>Object relational model frameworks solving the object relational impedance mismatch which is a set of technical and conceptual problems encountered in an object oriented program when using a relational database management system</p>

<p>Software architecture defines the high-level system structure of the software components, the discipline of creating the component hierarchy, and documenting this structure</p>

<p>Modern application development has extended the focus on quality attributes such as extensibility, reliability, performance, scalability, mantainability, availability, security, backward compatibility and usability</p>

<p>The focus is on non-functional requirements modern application development focus is on quality attributes that enable extensibility, reliability, performance, scalability, mantainability, availability, security, backward compatibility and usability</p>

<p>Architectural patterns and styles that have evolved over time with both the functional and non-functional requirements. A software architecture is typically built on a solid foundation using one of these proven architectural mechanisms. A poor architecture may expose risks, such as a system being unstable, being unable to execute immediate or future business requirements, or being difficult to manage in a production environment.</p>

<p>Develop the Service<br />
There are four major steps in service development- creating the entity, creating the data access tier, creating the business service tier and creating the JSON-based REST service, which will be integrated with the user interface. </p>

<p>It is best to start with a bottom-up approach, starting with the entity and going up to the REST service.</p>
