<p>This is one of biggest differences from other note taking applications. <code>.txt</code> files are not just the way <em>The Archive</em> stores your stuff. There simply is nothing else to this app than the text files. </p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why we don't use Finder file metadata for tagging but decided to use hashtags in the file? </p>

<li>Text is the most robust way to store data. It is ultimately transferable to all operating systems. </li>
<li>There are many ways to manipulate text files. Text editors for manual manipulation is just one of them. You can also easily automate workflows and write scripts with simple programming languages like Ruby or Python.</li>
<li>Text files gives <em>you</em> total control. We highly recommend to keep it that way. Don't use any app that stores things differently. That would imprison you and make a change of apps or operating systems quite complicated, also known as "vendor lock-in". A bunch of text files is easiest to transfer. Just copy &amp; paste.</li>
</ol>

<p>The plain text approach offers you the best of speed, flexibility, and control over your knowledge. It forces you to learn how to manipulate text <em>as text</em>. Text is the most important and most widely used container of knowledge out there. That means: Whatever you want to do with your knowledge on a computer, ask yourself: "How can I do this with mere text files?" Once you get the hang of it, you'll be surprised!</p>
