<p>Using the Netgear<span class="tag">Orbi</span> setup the device supports 2.5GHz (channel range 1 - 13) and 5GHz (36, 40, 44 &amp; 48) bandwidths and can hop through a number of channels to improve throughput and bandwidth.</p>

<p>A simple test was undertaken to find the best ping timings for a choice of 5GHz channels and the optimum appeared to be Channel 40. This was held constant and the 2.5G channels varied and timings measured.</p>

<p>See <a href="2dot6dot2-home-network-bandwidth-settings">2.6.2 Home network bandwidth settings</a> for details of the results.</p>
