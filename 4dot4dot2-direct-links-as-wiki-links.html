<p>In <em>The Archive</em>, if you put an ID in double brackets you create a direct link to the note that starts with the ID.<a href="4dot3dot3-note-identifiers">4.3.3 Note identifiers</a> All double brackets with IDs in them you have encountered so far are basically a clickable search in <em>The Archive</em>, selecting the best literal match of the search term to display by default.</p>

<p>The search results include all the notes that refer to this particular target. For example: If you search for <code>201705091535</code> by clicking on <a href="4dot4dot2-direct-links-as-wiki-links">4.4.2 Direct Links as Wiki-Links</a>, the search results include two notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>This note. You searched for it.</li>
<li>"Connection of notes". That note refers to this note. It contains the ID in double brackets, as <code>[201705091535](201705091535)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that a direct link refers to a particular note via its ID and shows you all the backlinks to that note. This gives you a bit of an overview for the context of the searched note. This context will become handy when your archive grows and navigating in it becomes harder.</p>

<p>Since double bracketed links are performing a search under the hood, you can put the whole title in double brackets, too, like this: <a href="4dot4dot1-connections-of-notes">4.4.1 Connections of notes</a></p>

<p>You can also create links into The Archive from other applications using the built-in URL scheme.<a href="4dot4dot3-links">4.4.3 Links</a></p>
