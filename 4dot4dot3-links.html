<p>First, remember that we suggest to stick to the plain text approach and use IDs to reference your Zettel notes from external sources, like digital Mind-Maps or spreadsheets. Sticking to IDs instead of application-specific features prevents you from suffering from app lock-in effects. See <a href="4dot2dot1dot1-software-agnostic-programming">4.2.1.1 Software-agnostic Programming</a>.</p>

<p>That being said, if you want to write scripts that remote control <em>The Archive</em>, or if you want to insert clickable links in other applications to open a note in this app, you can use the built-in URL scheme for these purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>thearchive://search/SEARCH_TERM</code> will filter your list of notes just like a manual search for "SEARCH_TERM" would; it behaves like clicking on <code>#hashtags</code>.</li>
<li><code>thearchive://match/TERM</code> will filter your list of notes <em>and</em> open a note that starts with "TERM", if any; it behaves like clicking on <code>[WikiLinks](wikilinks)</code>.</li>
<li><code>thearchive://matchOrCreate/TERM</code> will behave like <code>match</code> but creates a note called "TERM" if no match was found; it behaves like searching for "TERM" and then hitting return to create a new note.</li>
</ul>
