<p>When watching a training video or or online lecture it is helpful to make notes of any key learnings and extend the knowledge and practice into other areas of work or projects.</p>

<p>The issue is that video materials are spread across youtube and personal stores. The links to youtube videos can be managed by adding a url link to the video within<span class="tag">ZK</span>. Also, time markers can be used to highlight specific entry points into where the material can be located.</p>

<p>Where materials are stored locally, these can be indexed using<span class="tag">DT</span> and a link can be made. The<span class="tag">ZK</span> code can be assigned to the video asset in<span class="tag">DT</span>. This is a manual step but it does mean that<span class="tag">DT</span> can now be used to link together all tags.</p>

<ol>
<li>Index a folder of books or<span class="tag">trainingvideo</span> within<span class="tag">DT</span></li>
<li>The index will appear as a database</li>
<li>Remove all auto assigned tags</li>
<li>Tag all<span class="tag">book</span> and<span class="tag">trainingvideo</span> with the general class</li>
<li>As books and videos are watched update the tags to be more specific. </li>
<li>For example:<span class="tag">technical</span><span class="tag">comedy</span><span class="tag">java</span> etc. It is better to use simple tags and use appropriate filtering to narrow down when searching.</li>
<li>Add the<span class="tag">ZK</span><span class="tag">uid</span> to the book or video as a tag</li>
</ol>
