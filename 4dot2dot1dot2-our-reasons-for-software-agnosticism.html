<p>We believe that there is one simple reason to adhere to software agnostic programming as the very best approach to software development: the developer is not primarily motivated by fulfillment of his own desires. It forces developers to give up vendor lock-in and favor open standards and open formats. It means that you are willing to lose users and therefore money and reputation.</p>

<p>In other words: it puts the end user's interests first, and the business and the developer second.</p>

<p>Sure, computer users say they want dead simple apps where they don't have to learn anything to complete a task. But this does not serve them well. Removing all resistance will not make them smarter, better, or at the very least keep their data usable. (See why we think the plain text approach is superior. <a href="4dot2-software">4.2 Software</a>)</p>
