<p>There are a different ways to create a note, each with pros and cons depending on your workflow. </p>

<ol>
<li>Type the note title you want into the Omnibar and hit the return key. If you type a term in the Omnibar that is not used as the name of a note already, <em>The Archive</em> will create a matching note for you; if a note exists, it will be opened instead. </li>
<li>Use a Wiki-Link: create a link that leads nowhere, click on it to follow the link, then create a note from the Omnibar as in (2).<a href="4dot4dot2-direct-links-as-wiki-links">4.4.2 Direct Links as Wiki-Links</a> The Wiki-link feature is built on top of the search. Similar rules apply to entering a term in the Omnibar: if a note with the linked text exists, it will be displayed for you. If there is no matching note, you can hit the return key from within the Omnibar to create a note with the title set to the search term.</li>
<li>Create an empty note in <em>The Archive</em> without changing your search. Just hit ⌘N (or pick 'Note &gt; New' from the menu). The Archive will create a note for you that will be named "Untitled" and take you right into the editor. After you complete the note you can rename it by hitting ⌘R (or via 'Note &gt; Rename' from the main menu).</li>
<li>Use the "Quick Entry" popup window from anywhere on your system to capture a thought. You have to configure the shortcut in the application preferences (⌘,) to make it globally accessible.</li>
</ol>
