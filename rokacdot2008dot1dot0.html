Classifiers map the input space into predefined classes. For example, classifiers can be used to classify mortgage consumers as good (full mortgage pay back on time) and bad (delayed pay back). Among the many alternatives for representing classifiers, there are for example, support vector machines, decision trees, probabilistic summaries, algebraic function, etc.  </p>

<p>Notes:<br />
Classifiers are an important branch of machine learning that is used to map input data into predefined classes. For example, classifiers can be used to categorise a customer who is applying for a bank loan as low risk or high risk of defaulting on payments based on some input attribute values (such as age, gender, marital status, salary, credit card scores, etc). </p>

<p>Classifiers can be used as a discovery method to predict new and unseen sample data based on a model derived from historical test data and attributes.<br />
