<p>The core of our app is derived from Notational Velocitynv and its popular fork, [nvALT]. Why? It is the fastest app for note taking. We used the nvALT branch during recent years. The "nv" core delivers the speed and ease of use to the archive.</p>

<p>We stand on the shoulders of giants and make it a point to honor the ancestors of the archive.</p>

<p>Why is speed so important? The reason is found in basic psychology. The more you do something the more important small aspects become. I don't mind losing a second or two when I wait for the bus. I don't do it very often. But a second or two can be <strong>a lot</strong> when it comes to repeating steps in the archive. </p>

<p>Speed is important because it is one of the main determinants on how smooth the app can bend around your actions.</p>
