    abstract = {This book is for anyone who wants to learn computer programming and knows absolutely nothing about it. Of course, if you are wondering whether this book is going to teach you how to create amazing applets or incredible desktop or mobile applications, the answer is "no"that is a job for other books. So many books out there can teach you those skills in Java, C++, or C#. Many of them even claim that they can teach you in 24 hours! Dont laugh! They probably can do that, but all of them take one thing for grantedthat the reader knows some basics about computer programming. None of those books, unfortunately, bothers to teach you the first thing that a novice programmer needs to learn, which is "Algorithmic Thinking." Algorithmic Thinking involves more than just learning code. It is a problem solving process that involves learning how to code. With over 800 pages, and containing more than 300 solved and 400 unsolved exercises, over 450 true/false, 150 multiple choice, and 180 review questions (the solutions and the answers to which can be found on the Internet), this book is ideal for students, teachers, professors, novices or average programmers, or for anyone who wants to start learning or teaching computer programming using the proper conventions and techniques.},<br />
