<div id="content"><h1 id="free-will-problem">Free Will Problem</h1>

<p>Under this heading I mean to separate off those issues of<br />
Freedom that have to do with the <em>metaphysical</em> problem of free<br />
will and determinism. As opposed to political or theological<br />
freedom. This is also distinct from the problem of the compatibility<br />
of free will and divine foreknowledge.</p>

<p>According to [Peter van Inwagen]'s proposal we should understand<br />
the "problem of free will" as (I am glossing):</p>

<p>(1) It seems that free will and determinism are<br />
    incompatible.<br />
(2) It seems that free will and indeterminism are<br />
    incompatible.<br />
(3) If (1) and (2) are correct, then <em>free will</em> is<br />
    incoherent.<br />
(4) Moral responsibility seems to necessitate free will.<br />
(5) If (3) and (4) are correct, then no one is morally<br />
    responsible.<br />
(6) People <em>are</em> morally responsible.<br />
(7) Therefore, <em>at least one</em> of the "seems" in (1), (2), or (4)<br />
    is incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, "free will," "incompatibilist free will,"<br />
  "compatibilist free will" and "libertarian free will" are<br />
  four names for one and the same thing. If this thing is a<br />
  property, they are four names for the property <em>is on some<br />
  occasions able to do otherwise</em>. If this thing is a power<br />
  or ability, they are four names for the power or ability<br />
  to do otherwise than one in fact does.<br />

<p>[Peter van Inwagen]'s restatement of the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following two theses are <em>prima facie</em> incompatible:</p>
  
  <p>(1) We are sometimes in the following position with respect<br />
      to a contemplated future act: we simultaneously have<br />
      both the following abilities: the ability to perform<br />
      that act and the ability to refrain from performing that<br />
      act.<br />
  (2) The past and the laws of nature together determine, at<br />
      every moment, a unique future.<br />

<h4 id="de-caro">De Caro</h4>

<p>Mario De Caro argues that the very concept of an agent and agency<br />
implies a notion of freedom because being an agent involves acting<br />
on the basis of reasons and this involves both self-determination<br />
(an efficient cause is not a reason) and the ability to do otherwise<br />
(the reason selects among alternatives). If there is no freedom then<br />
there are no agents. If free will is a total mystery then the<br />
mystery will propagate to all fields that rely on explanations in<br />
terms of intentional action (history, psychology, sociology). [@de-<br />
