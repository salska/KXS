<p>Saved searches are one of the advancements from the <a href="4dot2dot2dot2-the-nv-core">4.2.2.2 The nv-Core</a></p>

<p>While working with nvALT, we recognized that we performed the same searches over and over again. A good example is a search for <a href="4dot5dot1-tags">4.5.1 Tags</a> that concern your current writing project. You will want to get back to the same collection of notes again and again, repeating the search all the time.</p>

<p>Remember the importance of speed we mentioned in the note about the nv-Core? Speed is one of the central paradigms we used to make decisions about this app's features, and saved searches are a great help.</p>

<p>For every step you do repeatedly, there ought to be a fast solution or you will cease to use this solution. This is one reason, by the way, why some apps don't <em>feel</em> right. They repeatedly force us into clunky work flows.<br />

<p>One if not <em>the</em> main principle of a Zettelkasten is the principle of connection. </p>

<p>There are typically three entities mentioned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Knowledge</li>
</ol>

<p>There are in a hierarchy with data being the simplest and knowledge the most sophisticated. One of the big questions out there is: How can you get from data to information to knowledge? </p>

<p>Every attempt to answer this questions has one thing in common: Connection. </p>

<ol>
<li>What to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?</li>
<li>How to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?</li>
</ol>

<p>While we don't have a theoretical answer to this theoretical question we can give the practical solution to knowledge work with quite robust confidence: Make connection possibel.</p>

<p>There are different types of connection:</p>
